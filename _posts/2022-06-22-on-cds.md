One of Agnes Nutter's predictions for 1972 read, "Do Notte Buye Betamacks." Less well known is her CD prediction for 1982. This read, "Ane shall ye Touche the Seedee, so itt be Smuddged." This prophecy helped her descendents avoid smudging their CDs for nearly ten years, until 1989, when Axel Nutter accidentally brushed his new Pixies CD with his pinky in his haste to extract the album (*Doolittle*). Axel proceeded to scratch the CD when he tried to wipe away the smudge with a cloth that unfortunately had a grain of sand stuck to it. The resulting emotional devastation dogged Axel for the rest of his life, and he never bought another CD. His resulting vinyl collection now has an estimated value of $2 million.
